            The exec attribute below can be changed to a command that SMF
            should execute when the service is refreshed.  Services are
            typically refreshed when their properties are changed in the
            SMF repository.  See smf_method(5) for more details.  It is
            common to retain the value of :true which means that SMF will
            take no action when the service is refreshed.  Alternatively,
            you may wish to provide a method to reread the SMF repository
            and act on any configuration changes.
